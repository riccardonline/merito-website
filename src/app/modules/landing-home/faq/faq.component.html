            What is the duration of the free trial?

              Our app is free to try for 14 days, if you want more, you can provide
              payment details which will extend your trial to 30 days providing you

            What is the storage is for?

          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              Since we provide an extremely detailed reporting and analytics
              tool, they require quite a bit storage space. For average use, you
              don’t have to worry about running out of space since the
              Personal package limits the projects you can have.
            </p>
            <p>
              For some reason if you run out of space, contact us and we will
              see what can be done about it and make sure you are not
              generating unnecessary reports and/or analytics data.

              If you are still in your free trial period, you can cancel your
              account at anytime with a single click of a button. If you already
              paid for your first month, we also offer 30-day money-back
              guarantee with no questions asked.
            </p>
            <p>
              After first month, you can still cancel your account at any time
              but we will calculate the amount that corresponds to days you
              have been using our app for that month and refund only the
              remaining amount.
